## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Load a whole PAN-OS or Panorama configuration and ask what a firewall
  actually gets.** Point the library at a configuration file and it tells you
  which device groups a firewall inherits from, the security rules that apply in
  the order the firewall evaluates them, which objects are visible and which are
  shadowed by a more specific definition, and what a shared dynamic address group
  resolves to in that device group specifically. It also indexes the result, so
  finding every rule that touches an address is immediate.
- **A Go model of the PAN-OS configuration, generated from the schema PAN-OS
  itself ships.** Point the generator at a firewall or Panorama schema and it
  produces typed Go structs for every configuration object, so a tool can read a
  configuration without hand-writing any of that structure.
- **Repository skeleton.** Project layout, build and lint configuration, CI, and
  the mandatory rules that govern the library.
